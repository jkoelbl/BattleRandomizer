# Battle Randomizer

This is a simple program that creates fictional battles for you through the use of randomness and a list of selected actions, players, and predetermined values. Although simplistic in nature, it is to be used to assist in the creative process when writing and animating.

### How-To

##### Usage

To use this, simply run "Battle Randomizer.py" as a Python 3 file. Need Python 3? Search it up online! It's not that hard to find.

##### Adding Characters, Moves, Reactions

To add characters, simply go to "data" and place your desired information into the files of your choice. Note that for both character health and move/special move damage, a number preceeds the character or action. That number and the character/action must be strictly separated by a semi-colon. This is so the program reads the information correctly, otherwise it will throw an error.

##### Finding the results of your battle

The results are within result.txt. Open it and enjoy the fight!

### Thoughts

This was created with the intention of helping myself continue my free writing without being hindered by time or illness. This was created in a matter of hours, of course, but it will be continually tweaked and changed as time goes on, adding new features and changing others.

### Legal Stuff

This is free, as in completely free. Although this is free for the world to use, I would like for y'all to cite me. Other than that, have fun!
